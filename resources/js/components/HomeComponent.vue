                            What is Spring Notes?
                        </dt>
                        <dd>
                            Spring notes was originally a sample project of back end work
                        </dd>
                        <dt>
                            Why "Spring Notes"
                        </dt>
                        <dd>
                            The name came about because the name of the company was "SharpSpring"
                        </dd>
                        <dt>
                            What does this application do?
                        </dt>
                        <dd>
                            This application registers users and allows the creation and editing of simple notes (title, body)
                        </dd>
                        <dt>
                            Sounds great! How do I start?

                        <dd>
                            Either register a new user, or use the test user. Once registered or logged in, you can then access the notes
                            page and some additional features. You can create/edit/delete/comment on notes created by you or other "users".
